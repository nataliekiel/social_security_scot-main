        This kit lets you rapidly create HTML prototypes.

      <p>
        It contains all you need to prototype anything from simple static pages to complex, data-driven transactions.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About this page</h2>

      <p>We recommend you add links to your prototype to this page, rather than delete it.
        You'll find this page in the kit at '/app/views/index.html'.</p>

      <p>You can change the service name by editing the file '/app/config.js'.</p>
