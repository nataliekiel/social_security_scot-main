  <li><span style="color: #B30000; font-weight: bold;">The real form keeps changing because the team is working to improve it</span></li>
  <li>It will probably be different when you complete the real one, but a lot of pages are going to be the same</li>
  <li>there is no error message: if you forget to add some required information for example, you will be able to go to the next step, but you would be stopped on the real form</li>
