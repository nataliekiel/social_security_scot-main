            <p>In September 2015 the Scottish Government made changes about what conviction information needs to be disclosed. [Some offences must always be disclosed, some offences do not need to be disclosed and some offences must be disclosed in specified circumstances.]  The rules are complicated, so it is important you read the guidance below as part of making your application.</p> 

            <p>NHS Scotland is exempt from the 1974 Rehabilitation of Offenders Act (Exclusions & Exceptions) (Scotland) Order 2003. As part of any offer of employment candidates will be subject to one of the following:</p> 
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">            
                <li>For posts in regulated work – Protection of Vulnerable Groups Scheme membership </li>
                <li>For all other posts which are subject to a criminal conviction record check – A Police Act check </li>
                <li>For posts not subject to a criminal conviction record check – A self-declaration</li> 
            </ul>

            <p>For more information on which category this post falls under please refer to the job pack, job description or person specification.</p>
