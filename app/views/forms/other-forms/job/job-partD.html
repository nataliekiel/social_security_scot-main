           <p>We want to ensure that our job opportunities are open to all.  
               The only way we can ensure there is equal opportunity is to monitor applications we receive and compare the profile of people who apply with those appointed.  
               Therefore, this form asks you for your ethnic origin, gender, disability, religion, sexuality and age.  </p>
